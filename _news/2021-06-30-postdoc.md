We are looking for a Post Doctoral Fellow to work on an exciting industrial project on adversarila robustness of deep learning.

For details see: [NewPostDocResearchML.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/)

Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral fellowship extendable upto 3 years contingent on availablity of funding at the University of British
Columbia. The successful candidate will conduct high quality research in machine learning with a
focus on deep learning and reinforcement learning to address issues around adversarial robustness in deep learning for safety and security critical applications. The principal investigator based in UBCâ€™s Department of Computer Science at its Okanagan campus
expect the research to have a significant influence on industrial practice.
