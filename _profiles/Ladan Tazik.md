degree: MSc
biography: I started my Master's in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Braun and Dr. Narayan (co-supervisor) in September 2020, and currently, I'm a Data Science Intern at Scotiabank. My primary research interests lie in the areas of nonparametric regression and artificial intelligence. In addition to working on my master's thesis about developing a non-parametric regression model for non-normally distributed data, I'm also studying classification/regression when variables exhibit monotonic relationships. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladan-tazik-306ab6101/
