  title: "TREM: A Tool for Mining Timed Regular Specifications from System Traces"
  booktitle: "Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering"
  year: "2017"
  address: "Urbana-Champaign, USA"
  abstract: "<p>Software specifications are useful for software vali- dation, model checking, runtime verification, debugging, monitoring, etc. In context of safety-critical real-time systems, temporal properties play an important role. However, temporal properties are rarely present due to the complexity and evolutionary nature of software systems.<br /> We propose Timed Regular Expression Mining (TREM) a hosted tool for specification mining using timed regular expressions (TREs). It is designed for easy and robust mining of dominant temporal properties. TREM uses an abstract structure of the property; the framework constructs a finite state machine to serve as an acceptor. TREM is scalable, easy to access/use, and platform independent specification mining framework. The tool is tested on industrial strength software system traces such as the QNX real-time operating system using traces with more than 1.5 Million entries.
